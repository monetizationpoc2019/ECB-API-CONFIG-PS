Set IsCleanupMode to true when scheduling an instance of this adapter to run in cleanup mode. 
If IsCleanupMode is set to false or not set in this file, then

If running this adapter in cleanup mode (<IsCleanupMode>true</IsCleanupMode>), you must specify the age of notification events to cleanup from NetMeter.
Set MaxNotificationEventAgeInDays to a number of days greater than or equal to 0.
For example, if IsCleanupMode is set to true and MaxNotificationEventAgeInDays is set to 30, then when this scheduled adapter is run, it will cleanup
all notification events that were created more than 30 days before the scheduled adapter runs in cleanup mode.
