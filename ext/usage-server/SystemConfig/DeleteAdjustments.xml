<!-- The PreBillAdjustmentSetting flag tells the DeleteAdjustments
     adapter what to do with pre-bill pending ('P') and/or orphaned
     ('O') adjustments.  The valid settings for this flag are:
    
     "delete" - All pre-bill pending and orphaned adjustments will be
                marked as auto-deleted.  This is the default behavior
                for this adapter.
    
     "abort"  - If any pre-bill pending or orphaned adjustments are
                found the adapter will throw an appropriate error and
                abort EOP processing.
